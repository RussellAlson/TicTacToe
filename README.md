#Game of tic tac toe

I tend to have a bad habbit of watching an endless amount of content on youtube for lessons. I pretty much watch more than doing.
So I guess I'm trying to actually do something. I figured a little project would get me going. Instead of forcing myself to work on 
projects I can't wrap my head around, I'll just do the little things. Tic-Tac-Toe just came to my mind.

This project is coming from a Youtube channel called Timothy James (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN0fXvWbJSk). 
I don't expect people to read these READMEs or other future post. I just feel my learning curve will spike if I write what I have practiced.
